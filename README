1. bin_delete.py -- Contains code for identifying binaries in rebound simulation (bin_find_sim) and deleting binaries (delete_bins). The latter routine deletes one star from every binary pair (it leaves the other star alone!). 

2. test_planet_moon.py -- Test if we recover binaries injected into rebound simulations. Also illustrates how to use the binary deletion routine!

3. With binary deletion the number of stars you end up with in a simulation will vary somewhat from simulation-to-simulation in a typical setup. To avoid this issue I suggest adding some extra particles at the beginning (comfortably more than would be deleted in delete_bins). Then after binary deletion, delete the excess particles, so we have exactly the number we want. 

sketch.py has some pseudocode illustrating how you might do this.
